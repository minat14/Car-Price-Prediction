    "In the original ML model used to predict car prices (based on their make, model year, transmission type, fuel type, and mileage) the algorithm used was RandomForestRegressor with no optimisation techniques applied. To attempt to improve upon this algorithm I tuned the hyperparameters, using cross-validation to prevent overfitting. This did improve the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also tested several other regression models and the best result came from plain linear regression, giving a result which was better than using random forest with the improved hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to further improve results I would try more feature improvement and engineering techniques in addition to the categorical encoding. For example, the majority of the variables are 0s and 1s due to the one hot encoding with only two columns populated by larger and more varying numbers and scaling these columns during preprocessing could improve results. It may also improve results to look further into the data provided for potential issues such as outliers which could be removed or replaced. I would also tune hyperparameters for the regression models that allow it.  "
